<h1>My Portfolio</h1>

<p>
  This is portfolio containing the list of all web apps i've built throught my career as a freelance developer.
I've built many web apps since 2016, but below are two recent projects i'm working right now.

    <a href="dalvis-static/index.html" target="_blank"><b>Dalvis</b></a><br>
    This is a web app for connecting gadget technicians and their costumers.
    The costumers simply specifize their gadget and its breakage, and their gadget will be taken to
    the nearest, available technicians. Their gadget will be returned back to their home after the repairment is finished.<br><br>
    My role on this project is on both front-end and back-end.<br>
    The technology i used for this project are:<br> <b>HTML, CSS, JS (with React JS), JSON, AJAX, PHP (with Laravel), and MySQL.</b>
    I also used Google Map API for easing detecting the costumers and technicians location.<br>
